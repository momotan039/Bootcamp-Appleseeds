                        I am Mohammed
                        I graduated from Ort College in 2022 with a diploma in software engineering.
                        An experienced web developer has Full Stack experience for over 2 years.
                        I am very passionate about learning everything new in this field.
                        I took many independent study languages before I started at Ort College
                        e.g Html , Css , JavaScript , C# , Python , Flutter
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that Programming work cannot be measured by a university degree,
                        rather it is measured by experience,
                        and how much we like it and how skilled and talented we are at it.
